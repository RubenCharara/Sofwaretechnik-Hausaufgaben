# Grading

|        | Ex. 1 | Ex. 2 | Ex. 3 | Sum   |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Points | 6/8   | 8/8   | 4/4   | 18/20 |

Remarks:
- Yes you can do it like that but that is really not the way to go. You do not just put all possible test cases into one.
  Instead, you write e.g. one test for exceptions, one test for "successful" computation (in this case, all results > 0), etc. -2p
